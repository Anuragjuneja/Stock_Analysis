# Stock Price Prediction, Trend Analysis and Portfolio Optimization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an LSTM-based model to predict stock prices and analyze market trends. The model leverages historical data to forecast future stock prices and assesses the accuracy of trend predictions across different stocks. Additionally, it aids in constructing a less risky portfolio by minimizing variance.


## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Scales and reshapes stock data for LSTM input.
- **Model Training:** Trains an LSTM model on historical stock data.
- **Prediction:** Predicts future stock prices and trends.
- **Trend Matching:** Compares predicted trends with actual trends and counts matching trends.
- **Visualization:** Plots the actual vs. predicted stock prices.
